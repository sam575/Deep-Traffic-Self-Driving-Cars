# Deep-Traffic-Self-Driving-Cars
DeepTraffic is a gamified simulation of typical highway traffic. The task is to build a neural agent â€“ more specifically design and train a neural network that performs well on high traffic roads. The neural network controls one of the cars and learns how to navigate efficiently to go as fast as possible.
